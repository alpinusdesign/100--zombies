# 100% ZOMBIES
## Description
100% ZOMBIES is a zombie-outbreak simulator.

A simulation run starts with 1 zombie and 100 humans.

Every night, every zombie will seek out a random house.
If the house contains a human, it will become a zombie as well.
A simulation runs until all humans have been zombified.

In total, 10 simulations will run, with some statistics printed out in the end.
